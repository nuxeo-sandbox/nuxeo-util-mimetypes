# Nuxeo DAM Dashboard

A dashboard for Nuxeo applications that contain the DAM add-on. It should work with any Nuxeo application unless the DAM document types and/or audit events have been overridden.

These are Polymer Web components.

## Requirements

The DAM add-on must be installed in the Nuxeo application.

Install Node.js (I use Homebrew)

Navigate to the folder containing `dam-dashboard.html` in shell/terminal and then:

    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt
    npm install
    bower install

## Usage

### Grunt

You can run it via:

    grunt

By default a proxy is created to localhost, to handle Nuxeo authentication.  You can modify "Gruntfile.js" to change the proxy settings.

### Polyserve

You can alternatively run it via `polyserve` but you need to make a few changes:

* Install polyserve:
  * `npm -install -g polyserve`
* Edit `demo/index.html` and modify the `<nuxeo-connection>` element with the URL for the server. For example:
  * `<nuxeo-connection url="http://localhost:8080/nuxeo"></nuxeo-connection>`
  * The user name and password can be included here as well. See the [`nuxeo-elements` documentation](https://doc.nuxeo.com/x/XJCRAQ).

Then run it:

    polyserve -p 3000

Once running, you can checkout the demo at `http://localhost:3000/components/nuxeo-dam-dashboard/demo`.
